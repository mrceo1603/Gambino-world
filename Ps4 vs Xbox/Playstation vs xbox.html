<h1> Playstation vs Xbox: Who Really Runs the show? </h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center"> Do they compare? Who really is the Winner?</h2>
 
<p>After nearly six years on shelves, Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 have evolved multiple times with sleeker designs, powerful 4K variants, new features and a steady stream of big new games. The Xbox One has tons of entertainment apps and can play a bunch of Xbox 360 and Xbox games, while the PS4 has continued to stand out by offering some of the finest exclusive games of the generation.

        While Microsoft's Project Scarlett and Sony's PS5 are slated to arrive by the end of 2020, the PS4 and Xbox One still have plenty of life left in them. If you're looking to pick up a current-gen console, here's how the two stack up.

    <p>Both PS4 and Xbox One play many of this generation's best titles, from third-party blockbusters such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Resident Evil 2 and Mortal Kombat 11 to beloved indies like Celeste, Stardew Valley and Dead Cells. Battle royale titles like Apex Legends, Fortnite and PUBG are available on both systems, and highly anticipated third-party releases such as Watch Dogs Legion and Cyberpunk 2077 will come to both.

            Still, PS4 is winning the exclusives war by a mile. Between big hits such as Uncharted 4, Marvel's Spider-Man, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and God of War, the PS4's exclusive offerings include some of the biggest and highest-rated AAA titles of this generation. 
            
            Death Stranding and The Last of Us II are still on the horizon, which should close out the PS4 lineup strong before the PS5 arrives in 2020. Despite a few middling releases like Days Gone and Detroit: Become Human, the vast majority of Sony's first-party PS4 output has been excellent.</p>

<h2>Pros for Xbox </h2>
<p> <b>All-in-one console</b>: While the PS4 is a game console that doubles as an entertainment hub, the Xbox One is set up as an entertainment hub that can play video games. Connect your cable or satellite signal to the Xbox One, and the console will handle TV programming, including adding NFL extras to augment live games. You can do two things at once with side-by-side pictures, such as having a video chat using integrated Skype while you watch a streaming movie.</p>
    <p> <b>Xbox Live:</b> Microsoft’s pay-for-play online network is a proven, reliable service for multiplayer gaming, streaming and more.</p>
    <h2>Cons for Xbox</h2>
    <p> <b>Higher price</b>: The Xbox One retails for $500, while the PS4 goes for $400. Yes, the Xbox One includes the Kinect motion and voice sensor, but even after buying the PS4’s similar PlayStation Camera for $60, you’re saving $40 with Sony’s system. At $60, Xbox Live also costs $10 more a year than Sony’s PlayStation Plus network.</p>
        <p> <b>Subscription required</b>: You know those cool Xbox One features such as Skype, NFL extras, Netflix and Hulu Plus? They require the $60-a-year Xbox Live membership to access — even though the last two also have regular subscription fees from their providers.</p>
